  <h1>404 Essay Response</h1>
  <h2>Tyler Smart 2/2/25</h2>
</header>
<main>
	<p> Before I started reading this essay by Kate Wagner called "404 Page Not Found" I found myself really thinking about what it would say to me that I didn't already hear before. I thought about the title and how it was an error code about not finding the resources you need and thought maybe it was about how internet focused the world is nowadays, (As a programming major, I thought I wouldn't like this article) but I soon realized it was more than that. It wasn't about how absorbed we are in the internet and how it's bad for us like other articles, it was more about how the changes to the internet and technology over the years has actually kind of made things less accessible. After reading this article, it quickly grew into one of my favorite articles to read about the internet since it gave a unique view on it. </p>
	<p> Kate first starts getting into the article and talks about her past with the internet and how new it was for her growing up with it. From simple search engines like AltaVista (which I never heard of in my life) when she was 5 to things like YouTube and Instagram starting to become popular while she was in high school. I thought this was a very informative and kind of relatable part of the article because it gives a bit of a time frame of how she grew up with the internet and how it wasn't so far off from my experience in terms of I grew up with similar things at a young age like YouTube and Instagram. Her life story with the internet segways into one of the first important points that stood out to me that she makes in this article which is how the old internet has been eaten up by what is the new internet (the internet of today). In the article she mentions "Like many people my age and older, I miss the pre&#150;social media internet. The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old internet. It amounts to an unforeseen form of technological cannibalism." She also states "Considering the average website is less than ten years old, that old warning from your parents that says to "be careful what you post online because it'll be there forever" is like the story your dad told you about chocolate milk coming from brown cows, a well-meant farce." When I read this article on the train on the way home I was surprised how much I kind of understood what she meant here. I grew up with the internet my whole life playing games like club penguin and watching videos and what I found the saddest thing about it was that those things don't last forever. Games like Club Penguin shut down their servers and old Youtubers I used to watch are long gone and doing other things now. There are times I wish I could relive those things that's not possible anymore and the internet has moved on to other things which is weird because I always saw the internet as once something is on it, it stays there forever. I think this was a big driven point that Kate made in her essay and it really stuck with me. </p>
	<p> As weird as it is to think about since most people have grown up with the internet for most of their lives (if not all of their lives), the internet was made about 40 years ago. This means that the internet will continue to evolve and change as that time keeps going forward and the things we are used to will eventually be replaced with other things that people will use. Now while that may be considered a good thing at times it is important to really think about what kind of mark it leaves behind and if we will be able to access some of the old information or applications we once were able to. I believe this article was a great read and recommend it to others. </p>
